====== Wheel Holder ======
Created Wednesday 28 October 2020

To be able to quickly create a lot of photos in a consistant way, a wheel is designed to mount 20 tools at once; using a stepper motor and a fixed camera and lighting setup the process of taking images would be automated for every 20 tools. The holder will be 3D printed so a few wheels can be made to be able to swap the wheels with new tools for an efficient dataset creation.
